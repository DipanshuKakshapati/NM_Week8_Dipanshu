    "This project involves simulating steady-state heat conduction on a 2D grid using the finite difference method. The simulation models heat transfer in a plate with the following boundary conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The top edge is maintained at a constant high temperature (100째C).\n",
    "- The bottom edge is kept at a low temperature (0째C).\n",
    "- The left and right edges are insulated, meaning no heat flux across these boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `10x10` grid is used to discretize the plate.\n",
    "- The simulation runs until the temperature change between iterations is below a specified threshold or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "- The temperature distribution and the heat flux in both x and y directions are computed.\n",
    "- The heat flux is calculated using central differences in the interior of the grid and one-sided differences at the boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The final temperature distribution shows a gradient from the top edge to the bottom, indicating heat is being conducted downwards as expected. The heat flux results are consistent with the temperature gradient, with no flux across the insulated edges and varying flux within the grid due to temperature differences.\n"
